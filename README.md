# SQL Challenge: Pewlett Hackard Employee Database

## Introduction

This project involves working with a dataset from Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company, containing employee information from the 1980s and 1990s. The objective is to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks using SQL.

## Data Modeling

The first step was to inspect the provided CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables. The ERD was created using QuickDBD. The ERD provides a visual representation of the relationships between the different entities in the database.

## Data Engineering

Based on the information obtained from the ERD, table schemas were created for each of the six CSV files. Key considerations included specifying data types, defining primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Composite keys were utilized where necessary to ensure unique identification of rows. Tables were created in the correct order to handle foreign keys, and each CSV file was imported into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis

Several data analysis queries were performed on the database to extract meaningful insights. These included queries to retrieve specific information such as employee details, department managers, department-wise employee lists, and frequency counts of employee last names.

## Collaboration and Acknowledgments

This project involved collaboration with a tutor, Reza Abasaltian, for assistance with the ERD and schema creation. Additionally, a study group was instrumental in completing the data analysis tasks. Valuable resources such as geeksforgeeks.org were referenced for understanding concepts related to primary and foreign keys ([GeeksforGeeks - Difference Between Primary Key and Foreign Key](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-primary-key-and-foreign-key/)).

## Challenges and Solutions

One challenge encountered was interpreting a query requirement regarding employees in the Sales and Development departments. Clarification was sought within the study group, and different query approaches were attempted to achieve the desired result.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provided hands-on experience in working with real-world datasets, performing data modeling, engineering, and analysis tasks using SQL. It helped strengthen understanding of database concepts and SQL querying techniques.
