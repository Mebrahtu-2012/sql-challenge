Worked with study group to complete the data anaylsis. For question 7 where it asked to list each employee in the Sales and Development departments was not cleare if it was requesting for employees in each of the department or both of the department. In our study group we tried a query request of 'Sales' AND 'Development' and 'Sales' OR 'Development. The AND did no work, there for we used the OR.
